There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he <strong>refuses to steal from adjacent homes</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>capability</strong> of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.</p>\n\n<p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code> representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> house from the left has <code>nums[i]</code> dollars.</p>\n\n<p>You are also given an integer <code>k</code>, representing the <strong>minimum</strong> number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least <code>k</code> houses.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least </em><code>k</code><em> houses</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 5\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nThere are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:\n- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.\n- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.\n- Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.\nTherefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4.
