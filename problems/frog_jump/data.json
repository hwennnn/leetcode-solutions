The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.</p>\n\n<p>Given a list of <code>stones</code>&#39; positions (in units) in sorted <strong>ascending order</strong>, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be <code>1</code> unit.</p>\n\n<p>If the frog&#39;s last jump was <code>k</code> units, its next jump must be either <code>k - 1</code>, <code>k</code>, or <code>k + 1</code> units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]\n<strong>Output:</strong> true\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]\n<strong>Output:</strong> false\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>2 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 2000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= stones[i] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code></li>\n\t<li><code>stones[0] == 0</code></li>\n\t<li><code>stones</code>&nbsp;is sorted in a strictly increasing order.</li>\n</ul>\n", "difficulty": "Hard", "stats": "{\"totalAccepted\": \"169.8K\", \"totalSubmission\": \"393.6K\", \"totalAcceptedRaw\": 169831, \"totalSubmissionRaw\": 393631, \"acRate\": \"43.1%\"}", "similarQuestions": "[{\"title\": \"Minimum Sideway Jumps\", \"titleSlug\": \"minimum-sideway-jumps\", \"difficulty\": \"Medium\", \"translatedTitle\": null}, {\"title\": \"Solving Questions With Brainpower\", \"titleSlug\": \"solving-questions-with-brainpower\", \"difficulty\": \"Medium\", \"translatedTitle\": null}]", "categoryTitle": "Algorithms", "topicTags": [{"name": "Array", "slug": "array"}, {"name": "Dynamic Programming", "slug": "dynamic-programming"}], "normalized_title": "frog_jump"}
