You should spell all the characters in <code>key</code> one by one by rotating <code>ring</code> clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the <code>&quot;12:00&quot;</code> direction and then by pressing the center button.</p>\n\n<p>At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character <code>key[i]</code>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as <strong>one step</strong>. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of <code>ring</code>&#39;s characters at the <code>&quot;12:00&quot;</code> direction, where this character must equal <code>key[i]</code>.</li>\n\t<li>If the character <code>key[i]</code> has been aligned at the <code>&quot;12:00&quot;</code> direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as <strong>one step</strong>. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/ring.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 450px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> ring = &quot;godding&quot;, key = &quot;gd&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nFor the first key character &#39;g&#39;, since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. \nFor the second key character &#39;d&#39;, we need to rotate the ring &quot;godding&quot; anticlockwise by two steps to make it become &quot;ddinggo&quot;.\nAlso, we need 1 more step for spelling.\nSo the final output is 4.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> ring = &quot;godding&quot;, key = &quot;godding&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 13\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= ring.length, key.length &lt;= 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>ring</code> and <code>key</code> consist of only lower case English letters.</li>\n\t<li>It is guaranteed that <code>key</code> could always be spelled by rotating <code>ring</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n", "difficulty": "Hard", "stats": "{\"totalAccepted\": \"30K\", \"totalSubmission\": \"64.2K\", \"totalAcceptedRaw\": 30023, \"totalSubmissionRaw\": 64197, \"acRate\": \"46.8%\"}", "similarQuestions": "[]", "categoryTitle": "Algorithms", "topicTags": [{"name": "String", "slug": "string"}, {"name": "Dynamic Programming", "slug": "dynamic-programming"}, {"name": "Depth-First Search", "slug": "depth-first-search"}, {"name": "Breadth-First Search", "slug": "breadth-first-search"}], "normalized_title": "freedom_trail"}
