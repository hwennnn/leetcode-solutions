{"questionId": "2012", "questionFrontendId": "1882", "questionTitle": "Process Tasks Using Servers", "questionTitleSlug": "process-tasks-using-servers", "content": "<p>You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>servers</code> and <code>tasks</code> of lengths <code>n</code>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b and <code>m</code>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b respectively. <code>servers[i]</code> is the <strong>weight</strong> of the <code>i<sup>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bth</sup></code>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b server, and <code>tasks[j]</code> is the <strong>time needed</strong> to process the <code>j<sup>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bth</sup></code>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b task <strong>in seconds</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Tasks are assigned to the servers using a <strong>task queue</strong>. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is <strong>empty</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>At second <code>j</code>, the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> task is <strong>inserted</strong> into the queue (starting with the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> task being inserted at second <code>0</code>). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the <strong>smallest weight</strong>, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the <strong>smallest index</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned <strong>in order of insertion</strong> following the weight and index priorities above.</p>\n\n<p>A server that is assigned task <code>j</code> at second <code>t</code> will be free again at second <code>t + tasks[j]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Build an array <code>ans</code>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b of length <code>m</code>, where <code>ans[j]</code> is the <strong>index</strong> of the server the <code>j<sup>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bth</sup></code> task will be assigned to.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the array </em><code>ans</code>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [2,2,0,2,1,2]\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>Events in chronological order go as follows:\n- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.\n- At second 1, server 2 becomes free.
