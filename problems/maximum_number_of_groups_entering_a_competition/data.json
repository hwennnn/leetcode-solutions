You would like to enter <strong>all</strong> these students into a competition in <strong>ordered</strong> non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The sum of the grades of students in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> group is <strong>less than</strong> the sum of the grades of students in the <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> group, for all groups (except the last).</li>\n\t<li>The total number of students in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> group is <strong>less than</strong> the total number of students in the <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> group, for all groups (except the last).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of groups that can be formed</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:\n- 1<sup>st</sup> group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1\n- 2<sup>nd</sup> group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2\n- 3<sup>rd</sup> group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18.
