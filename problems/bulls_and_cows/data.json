When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The number of &quot;bulls&quot;, which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.</li>\n\t<li>The number of &quot;cows&quot;, which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given the secret number <code>secret</code> and your friend&#39;s guess <code>guess</code>, return <em>the hint for your friend&#39;s guess</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The hint should be formatted as <code>&quot;xAyB&quot;</code>, where <code>x</code> is the number of bulls and <code>y</code> is the number of cows.
