Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules.</p>\n\n<p>There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given <code>releaseHydrogen</code> and <code>releaseOxygen</code> methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.</p>\n\n<p>In other words:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.</li>\n\t<li>If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.</p>\n\n<p>Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> water = &quot;HOH&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;HHO&quot;\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> &quot;HOH&quot; and &quot;OHH&quot; are also valid answers.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> water = &quot;OOHHHH&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;HHOHHO&quot;\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> &quot;HOHHHO&quot;, &quot;OHHHHO&quot;, &quot;HHOHOH&quot;, &quot;HOHHOH&quot;, &quot;OHHHOH&quot;, &quot;HHOOHH&quot;, &quot;HOHOHH&quot; and &quot;OHHOHH&quot; are also valid answers.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>3 * n == water.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20</code></li>\n\t<li><code>water[i]</code> is either <code>&#39;H&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;O&#39;</code>.</li>\n\t<li>There will be exactly <code>2 * n</code> <code>&#39;H&#39;</code> in <code>water</code>.</li>\n\t<li>There will be exactly <code>n</code> <code>&#39;O&#39;</code> in <code>water</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n", "difficulty": "Medium", "stats": "{\"totalAccepted\": \"35.6K\", \"totalSubmission\": \"63.9K\", \"totalAcceptedRaw\": 35644, \"totalSubmissionRaw\": 63933, \"acRate\": \"55.8%\"}", "similarQuestions": "[]", "categoryTitle": "Concurrency", "topicTags": [{"name": "Concurrency", "slug": "concurrency"}], "normalized_title": "building_h2o"}
