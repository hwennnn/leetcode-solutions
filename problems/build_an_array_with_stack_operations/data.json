You should follow the following rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.</li>\n\t<li>If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.</li>\n\t<li>If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to <code>target</code>, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the stack operations needed to build </em><code>target</code> following the mentioned rules.
