{"questionId": "2479", "questionFrontendId": "2402", "questionTitle": "Meeting Rooms III", "questionTitleSlug": "meeting-rooms-iii", "content": "<p>You are given an integer <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> rooms numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You are given a 2D integer array <code>meetings</code> where <code>meetings[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that a meeting will be held during the <strong>half-closed</strong> time interval <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code>. All the values of <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the <strong>lowest</strong> number.</li>\n\t<li>If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the <strong>same</strong> duration as the original meeting.</li>\n\t<li>When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original <strong>start</strong> time should be given the room.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Return<em> the <strong>number</strong> of the room that held the most meetings. </em>If there are multiple rooms, return<em> the room with the <strong>lowest</strong> number.</em></p>\n\n<p>A <strong>half-closed interval</strong> <code>[a, b)</code> is the interval between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <strong>including</strong> <code>a</code> and <strong>not including</strong> <code>b</code>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n- At time 0, both rooms are not being used.

The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).\n- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).\nBoth rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. \n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used.
