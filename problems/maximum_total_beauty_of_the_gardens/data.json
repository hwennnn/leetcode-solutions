Flowers that are already planted <strong>cannot</strong> be removed. You are then given another integer <code>newFlowers</code>, which is the <strong>maximum</strong> number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers <code>target</code>, <code>full</code>, and <code>partial</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A garden is considered <strong>complete</strong> if it has <strong>at least</strong> <code>target</code> flowers. The <strong>total beauty</strong> of the gardens is then determined as the <strong>sum</strong> of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The number of <strong>complete</strong> gardens multiplied by <code>full</code>.</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>minimum</strong> number of flowers in any of the <strong>incomplete</strong> gardens multiplied by <code>partial</code>.
