You also have several colored balls in your hand.</p>\n\n<p>Your goal is to <strong>clear all</strong> of the balls from the board. On each turn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pick <strong>any</strong> ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.</li>\n\t<li>If there is a group of <strong>three or more consecutive balls</strong> of the <strong>same color</strong>, remove the group of balls from the board.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.</li>\n\t<li>Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given a string <code>board</code>, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string <code>hand</code>, representing the balls in your hand, return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board.
