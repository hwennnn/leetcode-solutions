But, you should give each child at most one cookie.</p>\n\n<p>Each child <code>i</code> has a greed factor <code>g[i]</code>, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie <code>j</code> has a size <code>s[j]</code>. If <code>s[j] &gt;= g[i]</code>, we can assign the cookie <code>j</code> to the child <code>i</code>, and the child <code>i</code> will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. \nAnd even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.\nYou need to output 1.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have 2 children and 3 cookies.
