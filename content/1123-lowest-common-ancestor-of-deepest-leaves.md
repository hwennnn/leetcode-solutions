## Description

---
<p>Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return <em>the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves</em>.</p>

<p>Recall that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children</li>
	<li>The depth of the root of the tree is <code>0</code>. if the depth of a node is <code>d</code>, the depth of each of its children is <code>d + 1</code>.</li>
	<li>The lowest common ancestor of a set <code>S</code> of nodes, is the node <code>A</code> with the largest depth such that every node in <code>S</code> is in the subtree with root <code>A</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/01/sketch1.png" style="width: 600px; height: 510px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,7,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it&#39;s the lca of itself.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [0,1,3,null,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li>The values of the nodes in the tree are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>

## Solution

---
### Python3
``` py title='lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves'
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        
        def helper(node):
            if not node: return 0, None
            
            h1, lca1 = helper(node.left)
            h2, lca2 = helper(node.right)
            
            if h1 > h2: return h1 + 1, lca1
            if h1 < h2: return h2 + 1, lca2
            
            return h1 + 1, node
        
        return helper(root)[1]
        
```
