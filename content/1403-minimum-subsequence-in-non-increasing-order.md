## Description

---
<p>Given the array <code>nums</code>, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is <strong>strictly greater</strong> than the sum of the non&nbsp;included elements in such subsequence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with <strong>minimum size</strong> and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the <strong>maximum total sum</strong> of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>. Also return the answer sorted in <strong>non-increasing</strong> order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
<strong>Output:</strong> [10,9] 
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included. However, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.&nbsp;
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> [7,7,6] 
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to be returned in non-increasing order.  
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>


## Solution

### C++
``` cpp title='minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order'
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minSubsequence(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> res;
        auto sub_sum = 0, half_sum = accumulate(begin(nums), end(nums), 0) / 2;
        priority_queue<int> pq(begin(nums), end(nums));
        while (sub_sum <= half_sum) {
            res.push_back(pq.top());
            sub_sum += res.back();
            pq.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
### Python3
``` py title='minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order'
class Solution:
    def minSubsequence(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums.sort()
        res = []
        while sum(res) <= sum(nums):
            res.append(nums.pop())
        
        return res
    
```
