## Description

---
<p>There is a street with <code>n * 2</code> <strong>plots</strong>, where there are <code>n</code> plots on each side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. On each plot, a house can be placed.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are adjacent to each other on the same side of the street</em>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>

<p>Note that if a house is placed on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plot on one side of the street, a house can also be placed on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plot on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Possible arrangements:
1. All plots are empty.
2. A house is placed on one side of the street.
3. A house is placed on the other side of the street.
4. Two houses are placed, one on each side of the street.

## Solution

### Python
``` py title='count-number-of-ways-to-place-houses'
class Solution:
    def countHousePlacements(self, n: int) -> int:
        houses = spaces = 1
        total = houses + spaces
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            houses = spaces
            spaces = total
            total = (houses + spaces) % M
        
        return total * total % M
        

```
