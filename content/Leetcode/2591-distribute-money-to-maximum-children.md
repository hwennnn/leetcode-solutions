## Description

---
<p>You are given an integer <code>money</code> denoting the amount of money (in dollars) that you have and another integer <code>children</code> denoting the number of children that you must distribute the money to.</p>

<p>You have to distribute the money according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All money must be distributed.</li>
	<li>Everyone must receive at least <code>1</code> dollar.</li>
	<li>Nobody receives <code>4</code> dollars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of children who may receive <strong>exactly</strong> </em><code>8</code> <em>dollars if you distribute the money according to the aforementioned rules</em>. If there is no way to distribute the money, return <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> money = 20, children = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The maximum number of children with 8 dollars will be 1. One of the ways to distribute the money is:
- 8 dollars to the first child.
- 9 dollars to the second child. 
- 3 dollars to the third child.
It can be proven that no distribution exists such that number of children getting 8 dollars is greater than 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> money = 16, children = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Each child can be given 8 dollars.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= money &lt;= 200</code></li>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= children &lt;= 30</code></li>
</ul>

### Python
``` py title='distribute-money-to-maximum-children'
class Solution:
    def distMoney(self, money: int, children: int) -> int:
        money -= children
        if money < 0: return -1
        
        d, m = divmod(money, 7)
        
        if d == children and m == 0: return children
        
        if d == children - 1 and m == 3: return children - 2
        
        return min(children - 1, d)
```
